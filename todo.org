[X] Steps
Enable multiple steps for a use case

[X] Nested Steps
Enable multiple steps for a parent step

[ ] Dependency Injection

[ ] Shared State

[/] Doc
Get description and structure from use case and its steps 

[ ] Nested Steps - multiple files
Enable multiple steps in diferent files for a parent step

[X] Conditional Steps
Enable a If/Else constructor for steps

[ ] Request

[ ] Response
Be able to describe and validate the use case response object 

[ ] Use Case Error
